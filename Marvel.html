    <h1>Marvel Comics</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>This article is about the comic book company using this name starting in 1961. For the earlier comic book series,
        see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Mystery_Comics">Marvel Mystery Comics.</a></p>
    <p><b>Marvel Comics</b> is the brand name and primary imprint of <b>Marvel Worldwide Inc.</b>, formerly <b>Marvel
            Publishing, Inc.</b> and <b>Marvel Comics Group</b>, a publisher of <a href="">American comic books</a> and
        related
        media.
        In 2009, <a href="">The Walt Disney Company</a> acquired <a href="">Marvel Entertainment</a>, Marvel Worldwide's
        parent
        company.</p>

    <p>Marvel was started in 1939 by <a href="">Martin Goodman</a> under a number of corporations and imprints but now
        known as <a href="">Timely
            Comics</a>,[3] and by 1951 had generally become known as <a href="">Atlas Comics</a>. The Marvel era began
        in 1961, the
        year that
        the company launched <a href="">The Fantastic Four</a> and other superhero titles created by <a href="">Stan
            Lee</a>, <a href="">Jack
            Kirby</a>, <a href="">Steve Ditko</a>
        and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified as the company's primary
        brand.</p>

    <p>Marvel counts among <a href="">its characters</a> such well-known <a href="">superheroes</a> as <a
            href="">Spider-Man</a>, <a href="">Iron Man</a>, <a href="">Captain America</a>, the <a href="">Hulk</a>, <a
            href="">Thor</a>, <a href="">Wolverine</a>, <a href="">Ant-Man</a>, the <a href="">Wasp</a>, <a
            href="">Black Widow</a>, <a href="">Hawkeye</a>, <a ref="">Captain Marvel</a>, <a href="">Black Panther</a>,
        <a href=>Doctor Strange</a>, the <a href="">Scarlet Witch</a>, <a href="">Quicksilver</a>, <a

        Goblin, Kingpin, Red Skull, Ultron, the Mandarin, MODOK, Doctor Octopus, Kang, Dormammu, Venom and Galactus.
        Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most

    <p>Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely
        Publications in 1939.[5][6] Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the
        emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing
        company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor, managing
        editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother)[7] officially listed as publisher.[6]

        Timely's first publication, Marvel Comics #1 (cover dated Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl
        Burgos' android superhero the Human Torch, and the first appearances of Bill Everett's anti-hero Namor the
        Sub-Mariner,[8] among other features.[5] The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following
        month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies.[9] While its contents came from an outside packager, Funnies,
        Inc.,[5] Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist
        Joe Simon, teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes,[10]
        Captain America, in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one
        million.[9] Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring
        1941.[3][11]

        While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable heroes—many of
        which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer, Miss America, the
        Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel. Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton's
        best-known features, "Powerhouse Pepper",[12][13] as well as a line of children's funny-animal comics featuring
        characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal.

        Goodman hired his wife's 16-year-old cousin,[14] Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939.[15] When
        editor Simon left the company in late 1941,[16] Goodman made Lieber—by then writing pseudonymously as "Stan
        Lee"—interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his
        military service in World War II. Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different
        titles.

        Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of
        corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff.[3] One of these shell companies
        through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May
        1944). As well, some comics' covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946–47), were labeled "A Marvel
        Magazine" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961.[17]</p>
